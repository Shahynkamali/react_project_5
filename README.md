Project 5 was my first solo React.js project.
The MVP is an application that finds restaurants in North America and displays them to the user. The user can select up to 10 restaurants and add them to their list.
The user can search for a restautant by typing in the name and the city where the restaurant is located in. With that data the application makes an API call to the OpenTable API and returns the results back on the UX. The user can select a restaurant and add them to the list using the buttons. This events stores the restaurant in our cloud database handled by Firebase. Through firebase we display the users chosen restaurants on the UX. The user can add up to 10 restaurants in their list.

In the future, I would like to add more error handeling to the application. For example, I am currently working on a function that communicates to the user if there was no restaurant found.
